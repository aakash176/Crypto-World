# Crypto-World
Crypto-World is build using React and Node.
I have used some free API for the data which is displayed on the UI.
To run this application, take a clone of the repository -> create .env file inside server folder and add connection string of your mongo atlas and jwt token-> and you are good to go.
UI for the same can be seen below:
